# Semaphore game!
Welcome to the small game I wrote!

## What is a semaphore?
Semaphores are a method of communication, using flags and transmitting one letter at a time, that is in use for long ranges.

## How can I use this?
Just open up the website at https://pawos-howl.github.io/Semaphore-Game/ and start trying to learn semaphores.
